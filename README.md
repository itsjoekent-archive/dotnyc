README is a work in progress!

This repo is a custom static site engine I created in NodeJS to transform Markdown into static pages.

The frontend stack for this website is incredibly barebones. I plan to introduce a custom interactive iframe component in the future that would allow for more interesting features to be embedded within pages.

## Local Development

Requires NodeJS >= version 10.

```sh
$ npm start # Run locally
$ npm run deploy:staging
$ npm run deploy:prod
```
