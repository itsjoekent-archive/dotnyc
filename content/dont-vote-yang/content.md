Dear fellow New Yorkers,

**Andrew Yang is running to be mayor because he needs a high profile job to keep his political career alive, not because he cares about our great city.**

Yang is deeply unqualified, embarrassing, and is not putting forward proposals that would make our city better.

Andrew Yang is consistently polling at the top of the mayoral field, and it’s troubling to imagine that this many New Yorkers support a libertarian in disguise who has put out so many egregious statements and policy proposals during his NYC mayoral campaign, and past presidential campaign.

Please do not vote for the next mayor of our city because their name sounds familiar, and take a moment to familiarize yourself with not only his campaign's history but also the other candidates running for mayor.

Call me crazy, but I think we need a mayor that takes the job seriously as we enter a precarious moment of post COVID-19 recovery. This is a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reimagine and rebuild New York. Please New York, I am begging you, do not hand a political hack the keys to our city.

There are many qualified women running to be mayor, and because this is our first ever citywide ranked choice election, you can pick all three!
