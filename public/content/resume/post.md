Over the course of my short but ever-growing career, I've been fortunate to be apart of a number of projects focused on building tools to advocate for social or political change.

This page is a visual portfolio of some of the projects I've contributed towards, you can download my traditional resume [here](/content/resume/joekent-fall-2018-v1.pdf).
